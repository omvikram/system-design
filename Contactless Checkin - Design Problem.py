## System Design Challenge
## Design a system where we can allow contactless checkin for GOIBIBO & MMT hotel customers. 

## Clarify if you want to do contactless checkin only for Hotels or for flights also in future.
## What all you documents you want to collect during normal checkin from customers in hotel.
## Do you want to use automated process to verify a government document.
## Which all documents you want to save in our system or use third party service for that.
## What is the frequency when you wan to push notifications to customer for contactless checkin.
## How does the Hotelier Accept/Reject flow for the documents will work?
## How do you maintain the security of the whole process?
## Which all third party resoiurces or APIs you would like to use here?
